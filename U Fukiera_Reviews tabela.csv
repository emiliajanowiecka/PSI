U Fukiera,5,"""Beautiful restaurant with Polish specialties""",11.09.23,True,"""A restaurant with a unique atmosphere and food that melts in your mouth?? (dumplings are the best in town??).

U Fukiera,5,"""I recommend U Fukiera""",21.09.23,True,"""When we were in Warsaw last year, we liked the food very much, so this year, as we stayed in a nearby hotel again, we decided to return to Fukier for dinner and so we returned there every day of our stay. Delicacies from appetizers to desserts. Contrary to the comments I have heard, the prices are normal and the food is of much higher quality than in similar places nearby. Additionally, the restaurant has a pleasant atmosphere, from the cozy decor to the good waiter service. I highly recommend it and we will definitely come back next year"""
U Fukiera,5,"""random visit""",21.09.23,True,"""very, very good food, definitely worth recommending, I got there by complete accident, but it was worth trying, we ordered Ukrainian dumplings and pork chop, everything was tasty"""
U Fukiera,2,"""a waste of time and money""",22.09.23,True,"""Salad for the entrée with a crunchy addition, I don't know if it's a new condiment, but you could feel the sand in your teeth, uneaten- zero stars.Beverage- orange lemonade- sour like lime lemonade, can't you buy better quality, sweeter oranges for 60 zl for a carafe ? - minus.The biggest minus second dishes:1) the entrecote - inedible, hard, you can not even cut it along the fibers, let alone bite it, it does not matter how long the meat lies on the hot stone, all the time the same hard and stringy, only less bloody, on the advice of the waiter I ""cut"", more like tore a small piece and put it on the hot stone, it baked hard and still hard and basty, the cost of 203 z³ for such an entrecote ? I would not give it to my dog - zero stars,On the plus side, they did not add it to the bill, but I came to eat well for not inconsiderable money, not to have something deducted from the bill, if you still want to eat an entrecote at Fukier's I recommend taking a personal tooth irrigator, so as not to damage the gums2) pork loin - average, no revelation, I have eaten much better3) potatoes for pork loin and cabbage flawless, soups too, that's why there are two stars, not one.Summary- average meals for a much exorbitant price in relation to quality. You want to fill your belly quickly go to Fukier, you want to eat deliciously and have a culinary feast choose another establishment, you won't be annoyed spending your hard-earned money."""

U Fukiera,5,"""I recommend the dumplings""",02.10.23,True,"""A very nice restaurant, you can eat in the garden or in an atmospheric, beautifully decorated interior. It is worth going inside to be transported back to old Polish atmosphere. The waiting time depends on the number of customers, but we got in almost immediately and it was worth it.We ordered dumplings, they were tasty, the portion was large and there was a lot of stuffing inside, you can easily eat one portion, the only drawback is that we didn't have enough room for some cake. But the desserts looked tempting, so I'll let you know for information. It tasted delicious - I recommend it"""

U Fukiera,2,"""Tasteless soups""",20.11.23,True,"""I wanted my English friend to try rosó³ and ¿urek and I thought U Fukiera would be the best choice for that. Unfortunately, I was wrong. ¯urek tasted like mushroom soup, there was no flavour of the typical Polish ¿urek. Rósól, the same, very tasteless, pasta was not the handmade one.I'm very disappointed also because one soup costs 37z³ there. If you want the foreigner to try the typical Polish soups, don't try them at U Fukiera."""

U Fukiera,2,"""Disappointing and expensive""",27.11.23,True,"""A place that invites you to enter for an attractive showcase and with the Michelin logo to reassure its value. The staff is young and inexperienced, the tourist target and the quality of the food is absolutely dubious. Exorbitant bill (540 sloty for 6 ravioli, a pasta with broth and a veal steak passed off as entrecote, a glass of wine and two glasses of prosecco). Advice to Italians: leave it alone."""

Perfect considering the 0 degree snowy chilliness outside.We started with mulled wine and ordered the dumplings which were delicious. the lamb shoulder was incredibly tender and perfect. I ordered the Zurek, a very rich traditional soup which I also enjoyed. There were other Americans there so I think this place gets tagged as “touristy” as a result.

My husband and I had the pleasure of having dinner there with our friends. Everything was great, from the smiling, professional staff through the charming decor to the delicious dishes. The tiny and intricately decorated sandwiches with various flavors served at the beginning spoiled our eyes and then, of course, our palates. The sandwich with delicious lard also surprised with its taste. I chose the main course ""Duck very Polish with Antonówka"" - delicious, crispy skin and very tender meat, as well as delicious side dishes. The charming interior is complemented by live flowers, especially in the window overlooking the market square. The interior of the toilet is also surprising - it is not boring, there is something to catch your eye. Overall, we liked it very much - it was tasty and nice.Iwona"""

U Fukiera,4,"""Tasty Traditional Polish Food in Heart of Old Town""",29.04.25,True,"""Located in the Old Town, this restaurant is located in a 500 year old building.  We ordered the six course tasting menu.  Not every course was great, but two were outstanding.  Traditional Polish food.  If you order the tasting menu be prepared to have a long dinner as there is a break between each course.  Service charge is included.  Servers not fluent in English, but you get by.  Fil up quickly so you need a reservation.  Overall I rate this restaurant very good."""
U Fukiera,2,"""Touristy trap""",22.05.25,True,"""A centrally located restaurant in the Old Town. By far the most expensive in the area, which unfortunately does not translate into quality.The restaurant occupies the premises of a former wine warehouse, meaning the dining experience takes place in basement rooms that are hard to access, have terrible acoustics, and are stuffy and noisy.Not only are the prices high, but the business also has ways of extracting additional money. For example, before serving steak tartare—which normally comes with bread and butter—they offer bread and butter for an extra charge, and eagerly add it to the bill. They also include a service charge on the bill that cannot be opted out of, even when the service is far from ideal. And it is far from ideal, because the business knows it can't count on customers returning once they've been lured into the restaurant.All in all, it's a typical tourist trap—expensive, uncomfortable, and above all, with unfriendly service."""
